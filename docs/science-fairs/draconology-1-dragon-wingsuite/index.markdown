# Dragon Wingsuite  
**By Ariane, Grade 1**

> "I don't know, if a 5 m² or 10 m² wing is big enough for me to fly."

I ran this experiment to find out **If I can put together a Dragon Wingsuite and fly in it**.

---

## 📋 Materials
- Wingfoil Wing 5 m²
- Wingfoil Wing 9.2 m²
- Pilot, 22 kg, can run at 4 m/s, no prior flight experience
- Climbing Harness
- Climbing Carabiner

## 🔬 Procedure
1. Calculate the wing size and flying speed
2. Go to a grassy soccer field, no wind, no people around
3. Rig the 5 m² wing, put on the harness, try to run and glide
4. Rig the 9.2 m² wing, put on the harness, try to run and glide

## 📊 Results

After completing the steps above, here’s what happened:

- **Observation 1:** I could only do a small jump and couldn't glide with 5 m² wing.
- **Observation 2:** 9.2 m² wing is heavy, I could run, but couldn't jump.
- **Observation 3:** 9.2 m² wing pulls up only a little bit.


**Conclusion:**  
A 9.2 m² is not big enough and it is heavy. Maybe a 20 m² wing?
